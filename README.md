This is my project called as Startup Ecosystem Network. It's my first Full-Stack Project.
It's a social media network for startups in their various phases, for entrepreneurs, for various VC Funds, Angel Investors.
To summarise, it's a Reddit for Entrepreneurs.
## Project Details
* There's an Ecosystem Feed for each and every entity in this system
    - Entities like : 
      - Startups in their various Phases
      - VC Funds
      - Angel Investors
      - Startup Accelerator Programs
      - Startup Incubators
      - Universities
      - And many many more..
* There's an "Explore" feature which is backed by a recommendation engine.
    - Recommendations include :
      - Other relevant startups
      - VC funds,
      - Investors
      - Communities (What are they? See Below)
* There are Communities : Communities are just like how they otherwise generally are. A community of like minded people. Only here, there are communities of like minded individual entreprenurs and startups.
* Notifications to see:
    - Who upvoted your post
    - Recent activites that took in your ecosystem.
    - Who joined your ecosystem
* There are two more features :
    - Ideas and Research
      - A web crawling engine that crawls the internet to recommend a startup recent ideas, innovations, research, awareness, news about
        their domains.
    - Trend Analysis 
      - A backend compute engine that runs 24/7 nd analyses recent trends in an ecosystem, in a network of ecosystems, or geographically
      - Combined with recommender engines it would suggest organizations to check out these trends.
